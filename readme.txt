== Description ==


Many websites use a CDN (Content Delivery Network) service for their library data, such as images. These images then load from a CDN server and optimize the site/blog's performance.
When you start using a CDN service, you have to update URLs of all your images, for example if the previous URL was http://www.your-site.com/ it should now be converted to http://cdn.your-site.com/image.jpg.... jeez, changing URLs of all your images sounds like a hectic task, doesn't it? Thanks to the latest plugin we have made for you, it is not a major task at all.
on disabling the plugin your image urls will be reverted back to your default site links.
Note: The image URL rewrites works only inside the post content and can be undone anytime by disabling the plugin.
